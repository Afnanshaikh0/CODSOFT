# CODSOFT
Hello everyone, I'm excited to share my project repository from my internship at CODSOFT, where I successfully completed three distinct projects. The first project focused on Titanic survival prediction, a captivating endeavor that involved leveraging Python to analyze and predict survival outcomes based on various passenger attributes. This project allowed me to delve into data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, enhancing my understanding of machine learning applications.

The second project centered around iris classification. Through Python programming, I delved into the Iris dataset, applying classification algorithms to accurately categorize iris flowers based on their distinct features. This project provided valuable insights into the intricacies of classification models and their practical applications.

Lastly, my third project involved sales prediction using Python. This endeavor allowed me to apply data analysis and forecasting techniques to predict sales trends. By utilizing Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries, I gained hands-on experience in developing predictive models to anticipate future sales outcomes. Overall, these projects collectively deepened my understanding of software development, data analysis, and machine learning in a real-world context, making my CODSOFT internship a rewarding and enriching experience.
